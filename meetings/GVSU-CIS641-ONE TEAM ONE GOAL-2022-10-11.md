Discussion points: 

*   In the second week,we implemented class diagrams.

* While implementing, we have confused with a lot of stuff but somehow retrieved information about attributes and gained some perception of their relationships.

* We build relationships for class diagrams and gained an understanding of how our website looks like.

Goals for next week:

* For next week, we have dealt with creating object diagrams.

* Listening to class helped us creating these diagrams.
